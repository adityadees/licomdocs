# Introduction

Welcome to LINCOMDOCS!
Linux is a very famous, open-source operating system.

Many developers use Linux for development purposes because of its high throughput. As a student or even a professional in the software industry, it is very essential to have knowledge of the Linux OS. Many programmers prefer Linux over Windows OS for development purposes due to a variety of reasons such as the security of the Linux Operating System is better than Windows, the Linux terminal is way superior to the windows command line in many ways, etc.

## What is LINCOMDOCS?

Did you know that there are literally hundreds of Linux commands? Even on a bare-bones Linux server install there are easily over 1,000 different commands.

The interesting thing is that most people only need to use a very small subset of those commands. With this repo document, it is hoped that it can help us find documentation about all the commands in Linux

You can say this is
**LINUX COMMAND LINE DOCS CHEAT SHEET**

Feel free to contribute to make this repo better.

## Local Development

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.
